# OpenEEW

Let's create [earthquake early-warning (EEW) systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_warning_system/) for every seismically-vulnerable community in the world! 

OpenEEW is an initiative by Grillo to democratize EEW systems throughout the world by sharing our:
* entire archive of unprocessed accelerometer data from Mexico and Chile, including magnitude 6 and 7 earthquakes
* algorithms for the detection and characterization of earthquakes in real time
* hardware designs so you can build your own IoT-based seismic sensors

## Getting Started

Our accelerometer data will soon be available as an AWS Public Dataset. See [here](data/README.md) for details about how the data is stored. You can use our Python library to facilitate downloading required data. See [here](https://github.com/grillo/openeew-python/blob/master/README.md) for how to install it and some examples of how it can be used.
