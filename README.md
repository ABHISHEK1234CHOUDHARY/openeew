# OpenEEW

Let's create [earthquake early-warning systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_warning_system/) for every seismically-vulnerable community in the world! 

Grillo will be sharing years of raw historic sensor data, including magnitude 6 and 7 earthquakes. This will allow you to develop new detection algorithmns and train machine learning models. Grillo will also be sharing code examples to get you started, and hardware schematics to make your own sensors.

## Getting Started

We are almost ready to deploy !! stay tuned.
