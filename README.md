# OpenEEW
Let's create ***earthquake early-warning (EEW) systems*** for every seismically-vulnerable community in the world!

[OpenEEW](https://openeew.com) is an initiative by [Grillo](https://grillo.io) to democratize EEW systems throughout the world by sharing our:
* entire archive of **unprocessed accelerometer data** from Mexico, Chile and other countries, including very large magnitude 6 and 7 earthquakes
* **algorithms for the detection and characterization of earthquakes** in real time
* **software examples** for creating your own EEW server
* **hardware designs and firmware** so you can build your own IoT-based seismic sensors
* **application software** so that users can receive your alerts via mobile apps, devices and more.
* **guidance to help with your project** including deployment of sensors, installations, and more.

If you're interested in hosting a sensor in the OpenEEW seismic network or in accessing real-time data, please send us an email at [openeew@grillo.io](mailto:openeew@grillo.io).

We have a well-documented [landing site for OpenEEW that](https://openeew.com) provides additional information.

## What is an Earthquake Early-Warning (EEW) ?
An earthquake early-warning (EEW) system sends real-time alerts to people before the shaking arrives. However only several governments have attempted to build EEWs due to the incredibly high-cost of traditional seismometers, dedicated telecommunications, and bespoke software.

[Grillo](https://grillo.io) has already demonstrated that an IoT-based approach to EEW systems is not only within the reach of many global citizens, but [performs as well if not better than government-run systems](https://openeew.com/blog/eew-benchmark). Grillo's open source initiative, ***OpenEEW***, has standardized a mix of off-the-shelf components, software and know-how, to place effective EEWs within the reach of many underserved communities arond the world.

All OpenEEW projects require the following components:

- **A network of OpenEEW sensors**. You can [build your own](https://openeew.com/docs/build-sensor), [buy here](https://openeew.com/docs/buy-sensor), or use someone else's network.

-  **A detection system running on a server**. You can find instructions for deploying your own [here](https://openeew.com/docs/deploy-detection).

- **A method for sending alerts**. For example, to a Twitter account, via [a mobile app](https://openeew.com/docs/build-app), or an IoT device.
