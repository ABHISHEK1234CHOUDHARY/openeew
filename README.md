# OpenEEW

Let's create earthquake early-warning (EEW) systems for every seismically-vulnerable community in the world! 

[OpenEEW](https://grillo.io/openeew/) is an initiative by Grillo to democratize EEW systems throughout the world by sharing our:
* entire archive of unprocessed accelerometer data from Mexico and Chile, including magnitude 6 and 7 earthquakes
* algorithms for the detection and characterization of earthquakes in real time
* hardware designs so you can build your own IoT-based seismic sensors

If you're interested in hosting a sensor in the OpenEEW seismic network, please send us an email at [openeew@grillo.io](mailto:openeew@grillo.io).

## Getting Started

Our accelerometer data is available as an [AWS Public Dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/grillo-openeew/). See [data](data/README.md) for details about how the data is stored. You can use our Python library to facilitate downloading required data. See [openeew-python](https://github.com/grillo/openeew-python/blob/master/README.md) for how to install it and some examples of how it can be used.
