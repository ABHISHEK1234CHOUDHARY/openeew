# OpenEEW

Let's create ***earthquake early-warning (EEW) systems*** for every seismically-vulnerable community in the world!

[OpenEEW](https://openeew.com) is an initiative by Grillo to democratize EEW systems throughout the world by sharing our:
* entire archive of unprocessed accelerometer data from Mexico, Chile and other countries, including very large magnitude 6 and 7 earthquakes
* algorithms for the detection and characterization of earthquakes in real time
* software examples for creating your own EEW server
* hardware designs and firmware so you can build your own IoT-based seismic sensors
* application software so that users can receive your alerts
* guidance to help with your project including deployment of sensors, installations, and more.

If you're interested in hosting a sensor in the OpenEEW seismic network or in accessing real-time data, please send us an email at [openeew@grillo.io](mailto:openeew@grillo.io).

We have a well-documented [landing site for OpenEEW that](https://openeew.com) provides additional information.
